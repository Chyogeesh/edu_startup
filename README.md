It is a educational website
Concept:
SkillHaven is an educational app designed to offer personalized learning paths based on a user’s skills, goals, and interests. The platform leverages AI to assess user preferences, knowledge level, and learning style to recommend the best learning path. Courses are broken into short, digestible modules across various fields, from coding and design to entrepreneurship and public speaking.

Key Features:
Personalized Learning Paths: AI-curated courses based on user inputs, skill assessments, and learning history.
Gamified Progress Tracking: Track milestones, earn badges, and maintain streaks to encourage consistency.
Interactive Learning: Includes quizzes, flashcards, peer collaboration, and live workshops with industry experts.
Mentorship Program: Connects users with experts in their chosen field for guidance and feedback.
Mobile-First: Optimized for mobile learning, allowing users to study anytime, anywhere.
Skill Marketplace: After course completion, users can offer their skills to others in the SkillHaven community or external job boards.
